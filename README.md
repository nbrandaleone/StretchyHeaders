# StretchyHeaders
Duplicate stretchy/bouncy header effect of a tableView, similar to Yahoo News Digest app

This project is all about creating an interesting UI effect.  It also helped me understand different aspects of a scroll view,
for example how "contentInset" and "contentOffset" works.

Topics covered:
+ Configure a table view
+ Worked with prototype cells / custom table cells
+ Created simple mock model using Swift "didSet" to update properties
+ Track scroll events
+ Mask part of an image using Core Graphics (mask and CGPath)
+ Created impressive UX effect

Idea inspired by Yahoo News Digest App.  Tutorial by "Design Teardowns" by Matt Cheok
